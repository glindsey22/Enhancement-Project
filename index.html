		The purpose of this visualization is to shed light on the disproportionate amount of money most CEOs in American companies make when compared to the average salary of their employees. The median ratio between CEO and employee pay is 197:1, it can be observed that after this mark the average CEO pay increases significantly.

		Each circle below represents a company and is placed along the axis according to that company's pay ratio. Note that the locations along the x-axis are approximate, positions may vary due to the force simulation. Each company is classed into an industry, using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples were combined into one category for convinence. Additonally, circle size is used to represent CEO pay. It is interesting to observe that some companies have smaller pay ratios but higher CEO pay than the respective companies with similar ratios.
